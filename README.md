## Carcassonne

This is a slightly adapted, digital version of the board game Carcassonne.

Carcassonne is a tile-based board game in a medieval setting created by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede.
This project implements Carcassonne as an open-source platform-independent computer game that supports up to five players at the same time with shared-screen multiplayer mode. It stays true to the original look and gameplay of Carcassonne while making some changes, such as new tiles and minor tweaks to the emblems. It currently contains the complete main game, some features from extensions, as well as some completely new functionalities.

This is my personal project I work on whenever I have time available.
Development started in 2016, and since then, this computer game has been an ongoing project...
